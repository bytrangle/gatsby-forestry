Forestry allows developers and editors to manage their website in a variety of different ways. This enables developers to build powerful, static sites while empowering editors to take full control over their content.

Forestry set defaults for Hugo and Jekyll, other static site generators have to be configure content sections manually in the sidebar settings.

A draft toggle is displayed by default for Hugo and Jekyll sites, other static site generators can add a toogle field to their front matter template to mimick this feature.
