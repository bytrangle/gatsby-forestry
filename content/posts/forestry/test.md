The most basic type of content in Forestry is a page. Pages are any ungrouped content in your static site, such as an about page or contact page. For Hugo and Jekyll, they appear in the _Pages_ collection under _Content_ in the sidebar. Just point Forestry to your content in the sidebar settings to add new sections.
